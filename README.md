# PortfolioWebsite

This repository is dedicated to displaying what I have done to create my personal portfolio website. I have utilized JavaScript and the three.js library in order to build this website.

For developers: If you desire - you may copy the code and to understand and/or try to build a personal replication of the portfolio wesbite for yourself.
