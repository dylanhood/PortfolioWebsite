# PortfolioWebsite

This repository is dedicated to displaying what I have done to create my personal portfolio website. I have utilized the JavaScript porgramming language and the GSAP, OGL, and Three.js libraries in order to enhance the website.

For other developers: If you desire - you may copy the code to understand and/or try to build a personal replication of the portfolio website for yourself.
